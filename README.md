# PvPranked
PvPranked is a useful plugin to manage a ranks based on Player vs. Player (PvP).
Any killing made will increase the score to the assassin and lower the victim's rate according to a mathematical relationship. This is to say that if a veteran was to kill a newcomer the score would be minimal. This plugin is still in Alpha and it is clear some bugs are present.
